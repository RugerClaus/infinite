Found the plasma rifle sprite on reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/ihroec/drew_a_plasma_rifle_trying_to_get_better_at_pixel/ edited it into an actual sprite.
All music is original. SFX are as well with the exception of the current jump sound.

All bullets are my assets. The background images and player sprites are from a tutorial that I can't remember the name of, but I'll try to find his github to credit him asap

All the extra assets are unused as of now
