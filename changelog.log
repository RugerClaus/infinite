A 0.0.0.0.1 ---- LOG
You currently can't actually play, but the menus kinda work lol
Began implementing logic for player interactions
What you see is currenty what you get

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.0.3 ---- LOG

You can run, jump and the game side scrolls. Renamed this file to changelog since my stoned ass last night forgot that was a thing
also forgot to update the version on the changelog to 0.0.0.0.2 oh well. This is 0.0.0.0.3

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.0.4 ---- LOG

Side scrolling properly fixed for the most part, but I need to stop it from scrolling after the player has gone right a bit and then goes back. The scrolling will stop,
but I want to find a way to integrate a coordinate system to track this and make it easier for development.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.0.5 ---- LOG

I finally was able to get the scrolling correct and able to move all the way until the x position of the sky and ground reach x=-3000! That is huge.
The game will currently not let you go back once you hit that point due to scrolling being disabled after the sky and ground reach said x position.
Next up is likely a debug menu showing the current coordinates of the player.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.0.6 ---- LOG

I implemented the functionality and logic for a basic debug menu, currently showing the FPS and player coordinates accurately. Next implemenation
will no doubt be to animate the player. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.0.7 ---- LOG

Implented player walking animation. Animation class will animate any set of sprites. Need to animate a walking left animation or just flip the player. Need to implemented
jumping animation as well, but that's just one frame. Getting closer to implementing enemy logic and structures. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.0.8 ---- LOG

Completed implementation of player walking forward, backward and jumping forward and backward and holding still. So player implementation is there and just needs
to have the player sprites swapped for custom ones rather than these placeholders that have been really excellent. Fixed ground loading issue where it was still trying to repeat the
background from an earlier implementation when i was adding the sidescrolling.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.0.9 ---- LOG

Now you can toggle music and sound effects. Full integration of original music. Jump sound effect works. Also updated debug menu and it now displays the current version of 
the game both in the title bar and in the debug menu. Game now has a placeholder title on main menu. Next implementation will be a volume adjuster. I'm not certain about a
slider yet, but certainly a + and - button to turn both sfx and music up and down independently. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.1.0 ---- LOG

Passed the music manager to the Player object in the Game object's constructor to set off sound effects upon player actions. Upgraded to pygame-ce. Implemented volume 
adjustment in the main menu options. Can't adjust it in pause game yet, but I don't see why its necessary for now. Likely need to come up with a different system for
managing button states.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.1.1 ---- LOG

Separated all classes and my modularity paid off. The program works great so far. Started implementing enemy class.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.1.12 ---- LOG

Updated enemy class for basic enemy logic, and I've kind of lost it here. Gotta now come up with the game itself now that all the basic mechanics are in. Perhaps combat
mechanics. First however I want to integrate a system for the player to interact with the world. Going to make an Item class, and create several objects to pick up as
a proof of concept next I think.

A 0.0.0.1.2 ---- LOG

Set up inventory system despite not having it graphically visible yet. It will show the items in the console. Created an entity class. Created item class. Made it so items, 
players, and enemies are all entities. The entity class makes it so I can extend it for other entities (buttons,levers,and other interactive features in game). Still no
real direction with this. I think I'm going for a dungeon crawler tbh. I want a part where you come to a castle's ruins and Crumbling Castle by KGATLW plays. That would be
useful as that track and every other one on that album are in the public domain. 

One more thing, I hope I didn't break any of the Player object, and if you're crazy enough to follow me or my game, then I am truly sorry. This minor update took 6 hours 
because I was trying to invert the Y axis of the entire player interaction simply so I could A: show Y coordinates in the debug menu, and B: to leave room for a vertical 
aspect of this game. I'm going to try again, but I'd like to flesh out other ideas first now that I have them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.1.3 ---- LOG

Fixed player starting in the sky... I knew there was a snag left behind. Hopefully that's the last of it. It seems to have been. Anyway I have implemented a hotbar with 2 items 
added to the game with no particular order or purpose. You can control the selected hotbar slot with the # keys on the keyboard. However you can't do anything with it. This is 
an alpha. Committing this as is tonight.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.1.4 ---- LOG

Added logic for calculating distance from player to nearest enemy which will be useful for enemy pathfinding later. Made those x,y values visible in the debug menu as well. I 
also calculated the relational direction to the player of the nearest enemy. It is also displayed in the debug menu. Create UI directory for UI elements. Officially started
Inventory UI. Empty constructor for now, but will update more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.1.5 ---- LOG

Partially implemented inventory system. You are able to open an inventory, and it will store items picked up by the player. It can put them in the hotbar as well, but there's some
strange scaling problems still. Hopefully I'll get that resolved soon. Posting this because it does physically work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.1.51 ---- LOG

You can add and remove things from the inventory to the hotbar and back. The scaling issue with the hotbar has been fixed. Console now displays put (item) in inventory or in hotbar
depending on current item position stored in item. is_in_hotbar. Next changes are going to be stackable items. Perhaps food of some sort?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.1.6 ---- LOG

Massive update. Redid most of inventory system to now have stackable items. Added Food and Apples. Weapons have been deprecated in this version and are being reworked into the game.
I have redesigned the entity system to be highly extensible and DRY. Saves a lot of time in the end. It is very frustrating to add stuff though. 

Player Y system now still has -y up, but the ground is at 0 now, technically anyways. The world_y position on the player is all that matters for tracking motion. The actual Y is irrelevant.
The bugs are adding up for this game, but I am doing my best every release to keep them low.

The player's lack of animation continuing after landing a jump was the fact I was disabling walking.... or at least telling the Animation object that i wasn't doing so.
I may be adding gravity to items during this next update or two, but there are bigger problems.

I need to start figuring out how to get an item in the player's hand if it's in the hotbar on the selected box. It will be time to record some other sound effects like a bump sound
for the baton and a cool sound for the weird space gun.

After some careful testing after writing this, I discovered the inventory/hotbar system was unuseable. It worked when I wrote this and then I opened the game again and it broke...
I gutted the inventory system and stuck with the implementation of the Entity class and subclasses.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.1.61 ---- LOG

Created a new inventory system. It opens and closes and the rows are rendered independently. The first row is the hotbar, and I am tracking not only the index of the slots, but also
the selected slot index of the hotbar. I'll probably need to add something similar for the mouse hovering over the inventory boxes next. I wanted to commit now since the system is kind
of working more or less. I have removed player detection for item collisions. I am going to implement a collision class that will check entities for collisions and update the game
accordingly. 

I'm looking to now add stacking. The items themselves have a stackable property (is_stackable). I'm not looking to implement stack limits for now, but if I leave it out now,
I'll kind of be stuck with a system that can't limit stacking. There are games that don't so I'll have to remember to balance that. This is one of those crossroads decisions. 

I was going to add that. 

Removed scoring system as it won't be necessary for now. Moved the debug menu to appear in the top right of the window when activated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.1.62 ---- LOG

I have now integrated the baton in the items system so loading it in may be a challenge later along with other items. For now I'm focused on the inventory functionality and am trying
to avoid overlapping with other features, which is tough because inventory works with items and the player.

Committing this version now before I implement a drag and drop system for the inventory

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CANCELLED INVENTORY DEVELOPMENT FOR OTHER ASPECTS

----------------------------

A 0.0.0.1.65 ---- LOG

So I've decided implementing an inventory system has been a disaster. I'll have to practice with it in another project. Forwards we go. I'm thinking about doing a bit of a shoot em
up platformer with a science fiction theme. I'm going to dumb the item system down to 2 slots for weapons, 1 for throwables.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.1.7 ---- LOG

So I have started implementing the weapon systems. I have 2 weapons in here now, The Laser rifle and the Red Laser rifle... Fuck you I know. You can equip them and fire them. Need to
make it so the game doesn't crash when the player doesn't have one tho

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.1.8 ---- LOG 

Restructured Item object to more easily accomodate weapons and other subclasses of items. Fixed loading image locations to the Item object taking into account the item type.

Added extendable functionality to pick up weapons. Next will be switching weapons. I'll need to add more weapons.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.1.9 ---- LOG 

Added Magnum. Can swap items now. You can choose to pick up an item and you can carry up to 2 weapons. It works fucking flawlessly. Just as I was about to commit this update,
I was able to call self.kill in the item update method so the swap works seamlessly

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.1.95 ---- LOG

Made it so every time you pick up a weapon or switch weapons it plays a sound corresponding to the type of weapon it is. Added gun sound. Began implementation of Projectiles
and projectile logic

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.2.0 ---- LOG

Started working on this update on a linux box running python 3.10.12. That's fine in and of itself until I got a syntax error on line 44 of UI/debug.py. Now you'll see that 
file was updated this version for the first time since version alpha 0.0.0.1.61. I went ahead for portability's sake and updated that line to use single quotes for accessing
the dictionary for "nearest_enemy_data['relation_to_player'] so it works on the older version of python3. Not strictly necessary, but it's a change I figured I'd make. I have
never actually run into a syntax error like that being between different versions, but it makes sense, and there's a first time for everything.

On to actual news: 
I was able implement projectiles. The next thing I'll do is create collision logic for enemies. Right now the bullet shoots close enough to the weapon center not to make a 
difference or much of one, but still I'd like to track the barell of the weapon better. Not certain how to do that rn. need to create different bullets for different
weapons. I'll probably get on that when I create the collision logic. Probably going to have to rework the entire system knowing my luck, but oh well

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.2.1 ---- LOG

Gun shooting and aiming works well. Need to set more attributes of the guns, and damage, but other than that, it's complete. Going to add shields
for enemies and the player at some point. Will have to figure out enemy shooting mechanics, but first I'll just focus on the collision logic between the projectiles
and enemies.

Then I'll integrate throwables.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.2.2 ---- LOG

Added enemy projectile collision that kills and disappears both the enemy and projectile upon collision. It'll need to be refined, but it works okay for taking less
than 30 mins

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.2.3 ---- LOG

Changed render environment method to the World class. The World object will control the level mechanics. Going to have to implement a save/checkpoint system at
some point. One thing at a time. Going to integrate new worlds next. Going to edit them tonight. I believe I have enough files for a few maps.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.2.31 ---- LOG

Debug menu was crashing the game due to not being able to find the nearest enemy relation to player. Currently it's not doing it's proper job and showing if the
player is level with the nearest enemy, but it doesn't crash and that's such a minor bug.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.2.32 ---- LOG

Not a real update. Just adding some more assets to the repo before I go to work and work on this there
