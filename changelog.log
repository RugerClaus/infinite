A 0.0.0.0.3 ---- LOG

You can run, jump and the game side scrolls. Renamed this file to changelog since my stoned ass last night forgot that was a thing
also forgot to update the version on the changelog to 0.0.0.0.2 oh well. This is 0.0.0.0.3

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.0.4 ---- LOG

Side scrolling properly fixed for the most part, but I need to stop it from scrolling after the player has gone right a bit and then goes back. The scrolling will stop,
but I want to find a way to integrate a coordinate system to track this and make it easier for development.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A 0.0.0.0.5 ---- LOG

I finally was able to get the scrolling correct and able to move all the way until the x position of the sky and ground reach x=-3000! That is huge.
The game will currently not let you go back once you hit that point due to scrolling being disabled after the sky and ground reach said x position.
Next up is likely a debug menu showing the current coordinates of the player.

A 0.0.0.0.6 ---- LOG

I implemented the functionality and logic for a basic debug menu, currently showing the FPS and player coordinates accurately. Next implemenation
will no doubt be to animate the player.

A 0.0.0.0.7 ---- LOG

Implented player walking animation. Animation class will animate any set of sprites. Need to animate a walking left animation or just flip the player. Need to implemented
jumping animation as well, but that's just one frame. Getting closer to implementing enemy logic and structures.
